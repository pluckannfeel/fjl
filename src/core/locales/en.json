We realized they use the same format, and we wanted something different.",
      "description2": "So, we've developed a new kind of resume system that lets us discover not just a candidate's skills but also their personality and uniqueness during the interview. ",
      "description3": "This innovative resume allows candidates to share their favorite photos, videos, and answer special questions in a dedicated section. By visiting a website and inputting their details, they can create and download a distinctive and personalized resume in PDF format. Moreover, if a candidate is chosen for the position, they can receive an employment contract on their mobile phone within 30 minutes and sign it using digital signature technology. ",
      "description4": "This means that as soon as a candidate is selected, they can immediately receive and sign the employment contract, enabling them to apply for immigration the following day. Entering personal details into this system, along with uploading a passport copy and the notification of passing the prometric test, allows for the swift preparation of application documents for the Immigration Bureau. ",
