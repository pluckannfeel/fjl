We realized they use the same format, and we wanted something different.",
      "description2": "So, we've developed a new kind of resume system that lets us discover not just a candidate's skills but also their personality and uniqueness during the interview. ",
      "description3": "This innovative resume allows candidates to share their favorite photos, videos, and answer special questions in a dedicated section. By visiting a website and inputting their details, they can create and download a distinctive and personalized resume in PDF format. Moreover, if a candidate is chosen for the position, they can receive an employment contract on their mobile phone within 30 minutes and sign it using digital signature technology. ",
      "description4": "This means that as soon as a candidate is selected, they can immediately receive and sign the employment contract, enabling them to apply for immigration the following day. Entering personal details into this system, along with uploading a passport copy and the notification of passing the prometric test, allows for the swift preparation of application documents for the Immigration Bureau. ",

      "Hello, we at the Philippine Human Resource Development Lab (hereinafter referred to as FJL) primarily focus on the development and placement of Filipino talents who can speak Japanese. Amidst the numerous companies facilitating foreign talent placement, we specialize exclusively in nurturing and placing Filipino talents.",
      "In our welfare services division's home visit care office, many Filipinos are employed. When collaborating with foreign nationals, it's crucial to understand their culture, customs, religious beliefs, and values. It's important to recognize and respect each other as individuals to build a relationship based on respect and trust. The charm of Filipino talents lies undoubtedly in their carefree smiles and seriousness. Their presence tends to create a bright and fun atmosphere at the workplace, which is one of their many appealing traits.",
      "By collaborating with foreign workers with these points in mind, you can utilize talents with diverse cultures and values and deepen mutual understanding. In particular, Filipino talents are expected to brighten and enliven the workplace environment due to their cheerful and hardworking nature. FJL supports the recruitment activities of many companies handling foreign talents, offering a wide range of services including training programs and follow-up support that take into account the cultural and customary differences between Japan and the Philippines. Recruiting foreign talent has many challenges and difficulties. However, with the right recruitment mindset, understanding and respecting each other's cultures and customs, you can achieve good results."
